<p>Hi, I’m Jenn. I’m originally from Chicago but, in my search for great weather, BBQ, and music, I relocated to Austin, TX in 2013. </p>

<p>I graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a Bachelor’s of Science in Marketing and Information Technology. In college, I took classes in product and brand management, process and project management, and networking, database structures, and web application design. I was, and still am, fascinated by technology and how we interact with it. </p>

<p>After college, I worked for Accenture, Farmers Insurance, and Google where I learned quantitative and qualitative research methods and how to conduct stakeholder interviews, create user flows, develop requirement specifications, wireframe and prototype, and work with developers and testers. I strive to craft great user experiences and my passion for it has led me to Designation, a career accelerator for design, to further refine my skills. </p>

<p>I believe that great design can solve big problems and love that I can be a part of influencing and shaping the solutions.</p>

<p>I'm in the process of updating my website. In the meantime, feel free to download my <a href="http://actuallyjenn.com/jnoinaj_portfolio.pdf">portfolio</a> and <a href="http://actuallyjenn.com/jnoinaj_resume.pdf">resume</a>.</p>
