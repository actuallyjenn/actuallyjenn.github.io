{"name":"Jennifer Noinaj","tagline":"User Experience Designer","body":"![](http://actuallyjenn.com/img/1.png)\r\n\r\nHi, I’m Jenn. I’m originally from Chicago but, in my search for great weather, BBQ, and music, I relocated to Austin, TX in 2013. \r\n\r\nI graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a Bachelor’s of Science in Marketing and Information Technology. In college, I took classes in product and brand management, process and project management, and networking, database structures, and web application design. I was, and still am, fascinated by technology and how we interact with it. \r\n\r\nAfter college, I worked for Accenture, Farmers Insurance, and Google where I learned quantitative and qualitative research methods and how to conduct stakeholder interviews, create user flows, develop requirement specifications, wireframe and prototype, and work with developers and testers. I strive to craft great user experiences and my passion for it has led me to Designation, a career accelerator for design, to further refine my skills. \r\n\r\nI believe that great design can solve big problems and love that I can be a part of influencing and shaping the solutions.\r\n\r\nI'm in the process of updating my website. In the meantime, feel free to download my [portfolio](http://actuallyjenn.com/jnoinaj_portfolio.pdf) and [resume](http://actuallyjenn.com/jnoinaj_resume.pdf).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
